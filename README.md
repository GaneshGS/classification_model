# Machine Learning Code Challenge, Level 2

## Description
Using the Yahoo! Question-Answer Dataset, build a document classification model.


## Requirements

- Use this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BHICkntwHlD_KaaG2_0n6obV9fi_TqBv) to get the data
- Update this `Readme` with instructions to train and evaluate the model(s). At the minimum, there should be a `train.py` file for training the model and a `test.py` that returns evaluation metrics on the test set.
- Also include justification for any model architecture chosen
- Include any exploratory data analysis done before building the model (in a jupyter notebook or any other format)
- You can use any library you believe is relevant to the completion of the task

## Review notes

When reviewing the code, we will pay attention to:

- Code quality, maintainability and readability
- Data exploration
- Model architecture choice
- Evaluation method and metrics used
- Model performance
- Code testability and best software engineering pratices
