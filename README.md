# classification_model
The document classification model is built on the Tensorflow Platform. The model was built on the Yahoo Answers Dataset which has 8 million datapoints with short documents provided on various topics. I've used Deep Learning Architecture to build the model and it will be served on Tensorflow-serving and Tensroflow-js platforms for utilizing the model for document classification.

The use case of the model is that you provide any document as an input to the model and it will give you an output of which class does the document belong to.

Please refer the document_classes file for knowing the class tags the model uses for document classification.

The backend code is a classification model which is already built and the front end code of serving the model on the web platform is in process.

Perhaps, the model will be serving the model on the Tensorflow serving.
