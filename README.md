# Machine Learning Code Challenge, Level 2

## Description
Using the Yahoo! Question-Answer Dataset, build a document classification model and serve it.


## Requirements

- Use this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BHICkntwHlD_KaaG2_0n6obV9fi_TqBv) to get the data
- Update this `Readme` with instructions to train, evaluate and serve the model(s). 
- For serving, you may choose any technology you want, but there has to be an `http endpoint` that can be hit with data and returns predictions.
- Please include justification for any model architecture chosen in the `Readme`.
- Include any exploratory data analysis done before building the model (in a jupyter notebook or any other format) if applicable.
- You can use any library you believe is relevant to the completion of the task.
- We encourage the use of `python`, if you do not use `python`, please reach out to us.

## Review notes

When reviewing the code, we will pay attention to:

- Code quality, maintainability and readability
- Model architecture choice
- Model serving
- Evaluation method and metrics used
- Model performance
- Data exploration
- Code testability and best software engineering pratices
